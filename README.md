# Explaination
This is a fork of santa-land's [secret santa](https://github.com/santa-land/secret-santa). I wanted to tailor things to my family.
I added the abilty for a user to add a password so no one can snoop on their matches. 

# Overview
Secret Santa :santa: is a Western Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community :family:are randomly assigned a person to whom they anonymously :alien: give a gift :gift:. This is a MEAN stack app for secret Santa.

For frontend JSdoc redult is on [gh-page of this repository](https://alireza-saberi.github.io/secret-santa/), and back-end RESTful API I learned about the [Swagger way](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/05/26/swagger-and-nodejs/#.WLYUNIErKUn), and I add it to project.

## TODO
Time for this project was short. I have to add more stuff into that soon

- [ ] [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/): As my test framework.
- [X] Avoid dupicated Santa.
- [X] Create a password when registering so all matches are secret.
- [X] DO NOT Register spouse while a Santa registers, so both can set a password.
- [ ] Mutiple family events: Waiting for round one review from interviewers.
- [ ] Refactoring UI codes for log-in based pools: Waiting for round one review from interviewers.
- [ ] None unique participants: Waiting for round one review from interviewers.
- [ ] [Emailing secret santa participants](https://github.com/ejthompson87/secret-santa): Waiting for round one review from interviewers.
- [ ] [Secret Santa over SMS with Twilio](https://github.com/lukekarrys/secret-santa-twilio): Waiting for round one review from interviewers.

## How to make it work on your machine
- Assumptions: You have 'Linux like terminal', `node` and `yarn` on your machine
- Clone the repository on your computer
- Run `yarn` in the `root directory`, and in the `app` directory of the project to get all of the dependencies.
- Run `yarn gulp` to build everything in the `app` folder
- You need a `config` folder inside project `root`, and inside `config` should be one file `config.json`
- ```
{
  "mongodb": "mongo db connection string",
  "admin": "admin@whatever.com",
  "pass": "password"
}
```
- Type `npm start` or `node server.js` in the working directory shell.
- Go to your browser and type `localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3000/`

## Documentation
Using jsDoc3 and gulp-pages, I have provided a small documentation on the gh-pages of this project live [here](https://alireza-saberi.github.io/secret-santa/)

## General Assumptions
- This is for one family e.g Smith family. 
- Each family member registers in the Christmas gift exchange to receive a gift.
- People can not receive a gift from their spouse. 
- Each Santa should be able to consult the name of the person that he/she have drawn so he/she can buy an appropriate gift. 
-	We assume that all the participants have a unique name. 
-	To get the name drawn for a participant, a member just has to enter his own name in the application. 
- The gift exchange admin can activate an automated draw to impress those who participate and save time.
- Admin email and password are configured in the config.json file.
- Only if admin enters right information, then the pool can be stopped to build matches. 
- Only if admin enters right information, then the pool can be deleted. 

## My approach
- I found three dangrous scenarios.
  *  If parents are left at the end.
  *  One family of three people.
  *  Group of odd Santas if they exchange in couples, one of them will be left alone at the end.
- I found two approaches to solve this question. and I went with the second approach.
  * Person N will have change from 1-99 selection, N-1 from 1-98, and ... Challenge conditions will be applied.
  * We do shuffling for the Santa list. If the shuffled array of Santas meets the condition then we are good to continue
- If Santa enters his/her name twice server side should be able to handle duplication. With array it is easy. I was new to MongoDB but I fix it soon.
- If Santa enter his/her spouse name, sever should be able to handle and build spouse object too. With array it is easy. I was new to MongoDB but I fix it soon.
